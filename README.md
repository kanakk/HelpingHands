"Being SPECIAL is a matter of perception"

This project aims to develop an application that bridges the gap between the needy students and the aspiring social minded students who want to contribute their time in social work.

In the current scenario, there are many organizations working with the task for the empowerment of Special people.
There comes a situation where the real needy ones do not get timely and required help from those networks due to lack of network.

This application is all about making a open network where the organizations can put up their requests for scribe and those requests would be seen by all the logged in students or public and then they can help them out according to their interests.


This application is developed within time period of 24 hours at Mumbai Hackathon 2019
